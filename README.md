## Experiment only with chrome browser

- Ptable is the Classical Periodic Table for PC by Paul Alan Freshney [(c) Paul Alan Freshney 2004-2009].
- I made it to be displayed with the Chrome Browser with the addition of javascript programs that I compiled as limited as my knowledge ability.
- Because of the limited javascript knowledge that I have, not everything I do in the PC version can be included in the browser version.
- Almost all html page material and images are original copies of the classic periodic table for PC (Ptable) from PA. Freshney.
